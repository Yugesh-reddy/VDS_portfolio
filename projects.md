# Portfolio Projects

Below are some of the key projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in machine learning, natural language processing, data analysis, and mobile app development.

# Enhancing LLM Reasoning and Factuality with State-of-the-Art Pipelines
**Technologies:** Python, Ollama, Self-Consistency, ReAct, Retrieval-Augmented Correction (RAC)

- Designed and benchmarked three advanced techniques to **improve LLM reasoning accuracy** and factual accuracy
- Boosted **GSM8K reasoning accuracy by 15%** via Self-Consistency, deciding with multiple reasoning chains
- Implemented the **ReAct reasoning framework**, improving HotpotQA accuracy by **15%** and cutting hallucinations by **~12%** via tool-assisted reasoning loops
- Developed a **low-latency (<500 ms) RAC pipeline** with a hybrid retriever and RoBERTa-based entailment verifier, reducing factual errors by **~30%**

# Draft Score – Predicting NFL Quarterback Success
**Technologies:** Python,, 

- Analyzed **7+ NFL seasons (2018-2024)** across 1000+ data points using logistic models predicting QBR from draft position (**R²=0.30**, MSE: 432.33 vs 630.09 baseline) and classifying game outcomes (test accuracy **61.44%** vs **60.78%** logistic baseline)
- Visualized success patterns with **Altair/Seaborn**, revealing strong correlations between QBR, draft position and higher QBR, win rates, and passing yards, while highlighting **notable outliers**

# Fleet – A Travel App Using Flutter and Firebase [View Paper](link-to-paper)

**Technologies:** Dart, Ruby, Flutter, Firebase, Google Maps API, GCP, Cross-platform Development

- Developed a **cross-platform travel app** using Flutter framework for Web, iOS, and Android platforms
- Implemented Firebase backend for **user authentication, real-time data synchronization**, and secure cloud storage, **reducing data management overhead by 60%** and improving app performance
- Integrated **Google Maps APIs** for dynamic exploration, utilizing Places API to fetch and display nearby points of interest such as hotels and restaurants

# Additional Projects

## Machine Learning & AI
- **Recommendation Systems** using Amazon SageMaker with **25% improvement** in click-through rates
- **Fraud Detection System** processing **100,000+ transactions** with **92% accuracy**
- **Computer Vision project** using OpenCV and PyTorch for image processing and analysis

## Data Science & Analytics
- **Data visualization project** using Tableau, Matplotlib, and Altair for insights generation
- **Statistical analysis** and **predictive modeling** using Python and various ML libraries
- **Database management** with MySQL and MongoDB for large-scale data operations
